# Bank Tech Test

## Purpose
Practice producing best code when there is minimal time pressure.      
Practice Object-Oriented design and my TDD skills. 

## My approach
Using the acceptance criteria I first started the challange by diagramming user interaction using UML interaction diagrams. Following the interaction diagram I created class diagrams to help me to identify my class attributes and methods. Through diagramming, I came up with four classes:  
```BankAccount``` - that allows users to deposit and withdraw money from their account;   
```Transaction``` - will keep track of each deposit and withdrawal request to the account. Here the date will be recorded with each transaction and stored in a history. This brought about the 3rd class,   
```TransactionHistory ``` - stores the transactions generated by Transaction. The final class,   
```BankStatement``` - allows for the printing of all account transaction activities.   

The approach of separating into four classes is to allow single responsibilities, relieving the burden of one class having too much work to do.  
Following diagramming I then proceeded with writing initial simple spec tests so user can deposit and withdraw money. After successful implementation, I then refactored code to try keep DRY and lint using rubocop.

## Acceptance criteria
**Given** a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2012  
**And** a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2012  
**And** a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2012  
**When** she prints her bank statement  
**Then** she would see:  
```
date || credit || debit || balance
14/01/2012 ||  || 500.00|| 2500.00
13/01/2012 || 2000.00||  || 3000.00
10/01/2012 || 1000.00||  || 1000.00
```
## User Stories

```

## How to use
$ git clone `https://github.com/learningtocode101/bank_tech_test.git`  
$ bundle install  
$ rspec (to check all tests pass)   
$ irb or pry (to interact with app)
